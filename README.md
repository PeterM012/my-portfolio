## To Do

- Include Comments
- Compliant with Accessibilty standards

## Summary 
This project was to show how to properly refactor and improve the code base for sustainability and accessibility. Using semantic HTML I improved the quality of selectors and properties in CSS. I used comments between each line to provide organization and maintain a healthy form of communication between other developers. I also exceeded expectations with code using alt attributes and optimized the search engine parameters to meet the client's accessibility standards.
